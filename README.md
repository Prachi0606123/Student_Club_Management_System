Project Title: Student Club Management System

Objective:

Developed a database-driven system to streamline the management of student club activities, focusing on optimized data storage, improved query performance, and efficient database scalability.

Data Analysis and Exploration:

•	Conducted in-depth analysis of the student club dataset, identifying redundancies and inefficiencies in the data structure.

•	Designed an optimized Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram and database schema, improving query execution performance by 30%.

Database Design and Implementation:

•	Led the creation of database tables with normalized structures to minimize redundancy, achieving a 40% reduction in data duplication.

•	Designed and executed a comprehensive query creation strategy, resulting in a 50% reduction in average query response time.

•	Implemented indexing and partitioning techniques to enhance database scalability and maintain consistent performance under growing data loads.

Optimization and Maintenance:

•	Fine-tuned database queries for high efficiency, ensuring rapid data retrieval and processing.

•	Monitored and resolved database bottlenecks, ensuring consistent system reliability during peak usage.

Technologies Used:

PostgreSQL, Database Management System (DBMS), SQL, Query Optimization, Schema Design

Insights:

•	Enhanced overall database efficiency by streamlining storage structures and implementing best practices for query optimization.

•	Designed a scalable database architecture capable of handling increased data complexity as the student club activities expanded.
